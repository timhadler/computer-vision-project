This project implements transfer learning on the VGG16 Convulational Neural Network (CNN). The network has been retrained to identify static sign language gestures. The gestures are for the New Zealand sign language and are confined to letters. The demo video below shows the neural network in action and taking frames from a web cam. The predicted gesture is displayed below the cam video.
